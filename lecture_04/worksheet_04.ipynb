    "Both distances measure the distance between 2 points in multidimensional spaces. The difference lies in how these calculations are done. Euclidean distance mesures the stright line distance between 2 pts in a space - essentially the shortest bath calculated using the pythagorean theorem. The Manhattan distance is like measuring how far you'd have to travel city blocks in a grid system to get from 1 point to another. A key difference is that the Manhattan distance does not allow for diagonal movement, and may not produce the overall shortest distance between the 2 points.  "
